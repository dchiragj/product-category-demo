While developing this application you don’t have to follow the exact same design but we
are expecting something similar to this.
Also developing this application with TypeScript, using TailwindCSS and writing Test
cases is going to be a plus.
You are free to use any third party libraries that you would like to. Please send us your
project’s repository link.
Expected functionalities are as follows:
1. Get the products and categories from the API and list on the Home Page
2. When a product is clicked, navigate to Detail Page with that product’s information
3. With help of a button, go to Create Screen and create a product from there
a. Product object must contain these fields while sending a post request:
i. Name (string)
ii. Price (number)
iii. Category (string)
iv. Description (string)
v. Avatar (string)
vi. DeveloperEmail (string, you must enter your own email here)
4. When a product is created navigate back to the Home Page and show updated
data
5. Filter the listed items according to their Categories
There are 2 main tables (data sources) for this application which are Categories and
Products tables. There is no relation between these 2 tables.
